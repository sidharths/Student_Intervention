In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

We used three classifiers (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier and Decision tree) to do each of these 3 tests. So from the data of these 9 tests we can conclude that SVM's gives the best F1 scores on the test set and the second best test score for training data (second best only because the decision trees overfit and give perfect F1 score for training data). So in terms of performance the SVM classifier is the best of the three.\n",

      "SVM classifier relies on finding a hyperplane in at least a d-dimensional world when we have 'd' number of attributes. Hyperplane and d-dimensions might sound complex but in practice it is simple. Consider the simple case of there being just 1 feature and both data points lying at the same coordinate. Clearly we cannot mark a decision boundary here, however we can introduce another dimension based on some kernel function such that a sepration or cutoff point can be placed between them. This concept can help us to find a decision hyperplane when we have more attributes, that clearly seperates the data into two classes in a higher dimensional world. As a side note, do not let the word hyperplane worry you,  a hyperplane in one dimension is a  value, in two dimensions you get a line and in three dimensions you get a plane and so on.\n",
